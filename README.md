# Distance-Measurement-using-ultrsonic-rangefinder

Ultrasonic range finders are fun little sensors that can measure distance. 
You can use them to find the distance to an object, or to detect when something is near the sensor like a motion detector. 
They’re ideal for projects involving navigation, object avoidance, and home security. 
they use sound to measure distance 
can measure distances from 2 cm up to 400 cm with an accuracy of ±3 mm.
